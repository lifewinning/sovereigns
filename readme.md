sovereigns
==========

A lot of the things I work on come down to an interest in a straightforwardly impossible question: what makes a place *real*?

Lately at my job I've had to spend a lot of time looking at political and administrative boundary data, pulled from public government datasets. And I'm not really satisfied with these datasets and the expectation that they are entirely correct or complete. 

So I'm trying to collect some datasets about places where sovereignty gets weird. Disputed territories, economic zones, military bases, embassies, things I haven't even factored into this project.

`data` directory has some geojsons.
`documents` directory has some PDFs that need to be turned into data. 

This should be (and will probably be) a wiki.
