====================

Right now here's all we've got: 

- [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/)'s disputed territories dataset. More on this soon. 
- DC Embassies (thanks to [Ben Balter](https://github.com/benbalter) for happening to have already converted this dataset from the DC government's data portal so I didn't have to)
